# AI-Terminal-Assistant

This is a command-line assistant powered by Google's Gemini API. It allows you to type natural language queries like:

> "How do I check disk space?"

And it will respond with:
- The corresponding terminal command
- An explanation of what it does
- A safety assessment (e.g., is it safe to run?)

It can also execute the command after your confirmation.

# Requirements
